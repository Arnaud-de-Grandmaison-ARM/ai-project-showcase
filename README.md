# AI Project Showcase

This is a project showcase website built with Astro. Each card on the home page represents a project that was created or improved using AI developer tools (such as GitHub Copilot, Amazon Q, or similar). Clicking a card opens a detailed page about that project, including the challenge, solution, results, and links to more information.

npm run dev

Then open [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321) in your browser.

## üìù Adding a New Project Card

To add your own project to the showcase:

1. Create a new Markdown file in `src/pages/projects/` (for example, `my-project.md`).
2. Use the following frontmatter at the top of your file:

   ```markdown
   ---
   layout: ../../layouts/ProjectLayout.astro
   title: "Your Project Title"
   summary: "A short summary of your project."
   author: "Your Name"
   ---
   ```
3. Write your project details below the frontmatter. You can use Markdown for formatting, images, and tables.
4. Save the file. Your project will automatically appear as a card on the home page, and visitors can click to view the full details.
